Each game the 'shooter' rolls two dice.  
If the numbers on the dice add up to 2, 3 or 12, the shooter loses.
If the numbers on the dice add up to 7 or 11, the shooter wins.
If the numbers on the dice add up to 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, that sets the 'points', and the shooter continues to roll until the number
match the points then the shooter wins, of if a 7 is rolled, the shooter loses."
